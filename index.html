\textbf{Abstract}
\end{center}
The advent of COVID-19 marks a significant turning point in medical history, leading to
increased reliance on advanced technologies such as deep learning models. These models have
become indispensable for promptly identifying COVID-19 inmedical images obtained through
Computerized Tomography (CT), Ultrasound, and X-ray scans. This study aims to equip
healthcare professionals with an additional tool to improve the formulation of effective
treatment plans and containment strategies for the disease. A new hybrid architecture called
MobNetCov19 has been introduced for diagnosing COVID-19 in patients with comorbidities,
utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The research investigates optimized
versions of VGG19, ResNetRS152, and MobNetCov19 (VRM) models, facilitating a
comparative assessment of different imaging modalities. Despite the limited availability of
COVID-19 datasets, sophisticated detection models have been carefully developed.

\textbf{Summary}
The study reveals that CT scans excel in disease detection compared to X-ray and Ultrasound
scans. Researchers tested three models—VGG19, ResNetRS152, and MobNetCov19—
carefully adjusting parameters for accuracy. Augmentation techniques significantly improved
the models' precision, particularly in early disease detection. Limited data availability posed a
challenge for training more complex models. Results indicate that CT and Ultrasound datasets
outperform X-ray data in disease detection. The MobNetCov19 model, fine-tuned rigorously,
achieved impressive accuracy rates of 98\% for CT, 98\% for Ultrasound, and 96\% for X-Ray
data.
